## 🚀 What’s the Idea?

Campus Marketplace is a platform where students of IIT Bhilai can **buy, sell, exchange, or pre-order** items within the campus community.

Whether you're:

- A graduating student selling your **cycle or mattress** 🛏️🚲
- Looking to **pre-order food** from Tech Café or AtMart 🥪
- CoSA and clubs selling **merchandise, T-shirts, or hoodies** 👕
  — this is the one-stop solution.

## 🛠️ Core Features (Planned)

- 📦 **Student-to-student listing**: Buy/sell second-hand goods like cycles, books, appliances, etc.
- 🛍️ **Campus Storefronts**: Pre-order from AtMart, Tech Café, or any official campus vendor.
- 👕 **Merch Sales**: Allow clubs/CoSA to sell merchandise directly through the app.
- 🔍 **Search & Discover**: View what’s up for sale around campus (Amazon-style).
- 📱 **Mobile-first design**: Built as a progressive web app or native mobile app for quick access.
- dominos

## 👥 Who is it for?

- **Seniors** selling used items before graduating
- **Freshers** looking for cheaper alternatives
